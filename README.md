# AutoIt Scripts

A collection of some of my AutoIt scripts.
I wrote those years ago, and I'm not very proud of the code quality but hey, maybe someone will find them useful.
Some scripts require 3rd party UDFs which I no longer had on my disk, they are really popular so googling the names should do the trick if you're getting any errors.
